# Los Santos Roleplay: Chloe Gayford

**Precaution!**
- I've just learnt 3D modelling - there may be fatal exceptions that may result your game in crashes, I've however not experienced any crashes so far using this skin.


- I'm not taking credits for the wholesome job, all I've done is:
  - Removed the necklaces, earrings, and accidently a part of the left ear.
  - Re-textured the hoodie (removed the straws, added an Adidas chest logo and nudged the previous logo out from the stomach).
  - Added two more material textures for each arms with white Adidas stripes.


- The added Adidas stripes on the arms will come off as buggy, they're not well made but I did what I could. I will be improving my techniques as I experience with 3D modelling.


- The skin may appear differently on your client as this was styled after my own PED animations.
